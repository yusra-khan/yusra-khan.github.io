My personal website

<b>Project Name:</b> Convenience Store tour (30MFF website)
<br><br>
<b>Description:</b> The project was to shoot a short video in a group and then make a website centered around that video. My group decided to do a tour of the Convenience Store at NYUAD as our video. My website incorporates that video in the way that I have created it to mimic an online grocery shopping platform. It gives information about the Convenience Store, a tour of the place, an option to shop and a feedback form as well as (bogus) channels for contacting the store. The aim of the website was to make the viewer feel that they were shopping online for groceries.
<br><br>
<b>Process:</b> The header with the name of the store, a menu tab with links to all the different pages of the site and a banner leading to information about safe shopping during the pandemic are all elements that are common across all pages.<br>The Tour page is the main one that the site link leads to. It contains the video with a panel on the side depicting the actors and their names. The emoticons for the actors were downloaded from https://www.flaticon.com/packs/emoticons-2<br>The About page contains some information about the store and some pictures to show what it looks like. These pictures were taken from the Internet.<br>The Shop page contains a clickable side menu of categories and all items and their prices diplayed on the right. These pictures were also taken from the Internet.<br>The Contact Us page contains a form where you can submit feedback. The feedback is not actuall recorded, the page is refreshed upon clicking the Submit button. On the right are displayed some communication channels. The icons are sourced https://fontawesome.com/.<br>The fonts are taken from https://fonts.google.com/. The title logo is an image taken from the Internet. The shopping cart icon is also taken from https://fontawesome.com/. Clicking on the cart open an error window. https://paletton.com/ was used for the colors.<br>https://www.w3schools.com/ was heavily consulted in the making of this website.
<br><br>
<b>Reflection/Evaluation:</b> I feel like I was able to bring my wireframe to reality quite nicely. The website creates an entire context for the video and offers a lot of interactivity. One thing that I had difficulty in was figuring out how to change the displayed items in the Shop page on clicking different categories. I am satisfied with the end product and am quite proud of it.
